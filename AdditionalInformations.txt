About DevTools
To run the project with DevTools Java8 should be used. With 9 to 11 there seems to be problems at running the application.
Don't understand why but switching from 11 to 8 solved the issue that the app couldn't be started with the devtools dependency, 
without that dependency there wasn't a problem at running.

SpringBoot version
Version 1.5.8.RELEASE is used, the newest version (2.1.3.RELEASE)won't work here. There seems to be a problem that a 2.x.x version 
needs an other project structure or additional configuration files.
